,LIfe expectancy Dataset - v14 via Gapminder,,,,,,
,About this file,"This file has multiple sheets with data for one or more indicators used by Gapminder. In this sheet below you'll first find an overview of the indicators (measures) and the list of underlying sources. The actual data we use, is found in the sheet(s) labeled ""data-..."".
This file is also a documentation of the data process. To follow how the data was transformed from the original sources, start in the sheet to the far right, which holds the input data. You can then follow the process step by step, by looking at the formulas in the sheets from right to left, until you reach the output in the ""data-..."" sheets.",,,,,

,Dataset description:,"Life experience data is compiled by Gapimnder based on multiple sources mainly data from Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in their Global Burden Disease studies (GBD 2019), World Population Prospects 2019 and Gapminder-Life expexctancy  v.7 which is based on 100 sources and compiled by Mattias Lindgre. The data is combined as  follow:- For the period between 1970-2019, we  use the data from IHME GBD 2019. To go back in time  we have combined the IHME data with our historic  data from V7 and adjusted the  data for 80 years so that it meets IHME data for the first year it exists. From 2020 up to 2100 we have extended IHME series with UN forecasts. In this version , we capture the impact  of covid19 on life expectancy for the year 2020. Based data from Eurostat, Aburto et al. in their research paper and Heuveline & TZen M, most  countries has recorded a decrease in life expectancy. A decrease that in all cases is associated to covid deaths and  deaths induced by covid19.  A more detailed methodology can be accessed through the link below.",,,,,
