,About this file,"This file has multiple sheets with data for one or more indicators used by Gapminder. In this sheet below you'll first find an overview of the indicators (measures) and the list of underlying sources. The actual data we use, is found in the sheet(s) labeled ""data-..."".
This file is also a documentation of the data process. To follow how the data was transformed from the original sources, start in the sheet to the far right, which holds the input data. You can then follow the process step by step, by looking at the formulas in the sheets from right to left, until you reach the output in the ""data-..."" sheets.",,,,,

1,Happiness score (WHR),"This is the national average response to the question of life evaluations asking the following “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder. Gapminder has converted this indicator's scale from 0 to 100 to easly communicate it in terms of percentage. ",Happiness score (WHR),Percent,hapiscore_whr,measure,2

,Dataset description:,"Happiness data is published in the World Happiness Report of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network using data collected by Gallup World Poll. Gallup is a set of national representative surveys undertaken in more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. The main life evaluation question asked in the poll is: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” (Also known as the “Cantril Ladder”.). Gapminder imported times series data from the period 2005 until 2020 from World Happiness Report, 2021. The 2018-2020 ranking of happiness scores includes 149 countries/territories; only two third of them (95 to be precise) have survey information in 2020. The remaining countries’ ranking are based on surveys in 2018 and 2019. We converted countries-etc' happiness score from a scale of 0-10 to scale 0-100. In addition, we calculated the weighted average happiness score using countries-etc' population as weights for four regions (as defined by Gapminder) and global.",,,,,
